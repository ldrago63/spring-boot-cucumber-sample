# Why this sample

This application is just a simple spring boot app with a minimalist thymeleaf UI and a sample test package using **Cucumber**, **OpenFeign** to test REST APIs and **Selnium** to test UI.

To have a better cucumber report **Masterthought** cucumber reporting is used.

# Easy to use

#### Gherkins file are in resources folder :

    src/test/resources/features

#### Java steps for feature files are in test package :

    src/test/java/com/ldrago/sample/cucumbersample/cucumber/steps

#### To test APIs, steps use feing client. They just extend controller interfaces and define base url : 

    @FeignClient(name="personsClient", url = "http://localhost:8080/api/persons")
    public interface PersonsClient extends PersonsController {
    }

Next, with spring IoC, you must just inject your feign client to call controller methods.

Selenium java web pages used by steps are in test package :

    src/test/java/com/ldrago/sample/cucumbersample/cucumber/steps/webpages

#### Annoted scenario with *@webui* take automatically a browser screenshot for report when scenario fails.

#### Web driver are automatically installed by the magical webdrivermanager project of Boni Garc√≠a [https://github.com/bonigarcia](https://github.com/bonigarcia)

The used browser is defined in *SeleniumConfiguration* class and can be replaced :

    @Configuration
    public class SeleniumConfiguration {
	    @Bean
	    public WebDriver webDriver() {
	        WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
	        return new ChromeDriver();
	    }
    }

#### To launch this sample, just use :

    mvn clean install
